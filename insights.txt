3. Energy Type Insights
Production by Energy Type:
    Biomass, Wind, and Geothermal are the top contributors to renewable energy production.
    Solar and Hydro are slightly lower but still significant contributors.
Investments by Energy Type:
    Biomass and Geothermal received the highest investments, followed by Wind and Solar.
    Hydro received the least investment, possibly due to its already established infrastructure in many regions.
Installed Capacity by Energy Type:
    Biomass and Wind have the highest installed capacities, followed by Geothermal and Solar.
    Hydro has the lowest installed capacity, reflecting its limited expansion compared to other sources.
Proportion of Renewables by Energy Type:
    Hydro and Biomass have the highest proportion of renewables, indicating their efficiency and reliability as renewable sources.

4. Efficiency Insights
Investment Efficiency (Production per Billion USD):
    China, Japan, and India are the most efficient in converting investments into energy production.
    USA, Brazil, and Australia are the least efficient, indicating potential inefficiencies in their renewable energy projects.
Production Efficiency (Production per MW Installed):
    Germany, USA, and China are the most efficient in utilizing installed capacity.
    India, Brazil, and Russia are the least efficient, suggesting underutilization of their infrastructure.

5. Policy Impact Insights
Renewable Energy Targets:
    Countries with targets produce slightly more energy (58.62 million GWh) and have a higher proportion of renewables (49.89%) compared to those without targets.
    However, countries without targets have slightly higher investments and installed capacity, suggesting that market-driven initiatives may also play a role.
Government Policies:
    Countries without government policies produce slightly more energy (59.08 million GWh) and have a slightly higher proportion of renewables (50.01%) compared to those with policies.
    This counterintuitive result suggests that policies alone are not sufficient and must be effectively implemented.

6. Yearly Trends
Production Growth: Renewable energy production has fluctuated over the years, with notable dips in some years (e.g., 2009, 2017, 2020) likely due to economic or policy changes.
Investment Growth: Investments have also fluctuated, with peaks in certain years (e.g., 2010, 2018) indicating periods of increased focus on renewable energy.
Capacity Growth: Installed capacity has generally increased, reflecting ongoing infrastructure development.
Proportion of Renewables: The proportion of renewables has remained relatively stable, with slight increases in some years.

7. Correlation Matrix Insights
The correlation matrix provides insights into the relationships between various renewable energy factors and production.

Strong Positive Correlations
    Production_per_Capacity (0.151233):
        Countries that produce more energy per MW of installed capacity tend to have slightly higher total production.
    Production_per_Investment (0.079829):
        Countries that are more efficient in converting investments into energy production tend to have slightly higher total production.
    Average Annual Temperature (0.058260):
        Warmer climates may slightly favor renewable energy production (e.g., solar energy).
    Public-Private Partnerships in Energy (0.035390):
        Collaboration between public and private sectors may contribute to higher production.

Weak Negative Correlations
    Investments (USD) (-0.004613):
        Surprisingly, higher investments show a very weak negative correlation with production, possibly due to inefficiencies in some countries.
    Installed Capacity (MW) (-0.031234):
        This counterintuitive result suggests that higher installed capacity does not always translate to higher production, possibly due to underutilization.
    GDP (-0.031673):
        Wealthier countries may not necessarily produce more renewable energy, as they might rely on other energy sources.

Recommendations
1. Improve Investment Efficiency
    Countries like the USA, Brazil, and Australia should focus on improving the efficiency of their investments by:
        Conducting feasibility studies before large-scale projects.
        Investing in advanced technologies to maximize energy output.
2. Optimize Installed Capacity
    Countries like India, Brazil, and Russia should focus on better utilizing their installed capacity by:
        Upgrading existing infrastructure.
        Implementing smart grid technologies to improve energy distribution.
3. Strengthen Policy Implementation
    Countries with renewable energy policies should focus on effective implementation by:
        Setting measurable targets and monitoring progress.
        Encouraging public-private partnerships to drive innovation and efficiency.
4. Leverage Market-Driven Initiatives
    Countries without policies but with strong market-driven initiatives (e.g., the UK) should:
        Continue fostering private sector involvement.
        Provide incentives for renewable energy projects.
5. Address Climate Change
    Countries should focus on addressing climate change by:
        Implementing renewable energy sources that are climate-friendly.

        Balancing investments across energy types to reduce dependency on a single source.
7. Focus on Low-Performing Countries
    Countries like the UK (low production, investment, and capacity) should:
        Increase investments in renewable energy infrastructure.
        Collaborate with high-performing countries like France and China to adopt best practices.
8. Address Yearly Fluctuations
    Governments and organizations should investigate the causes of yearly fluctuations in production and investments and take corrective actions to ensure steady growth.
9. Promote Global Collaboration
    High-performing countries like France, China, and India should share their expertise with lower-performing countries to accelerate global renewable energy adoption.
